#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]

//! A pallet that defines a system to register and update names
//! in a Substrate chain.
//!
//! The core concept is that of a *name*.  This is some identifier (the exact
//! type can be configured through the module's [`Trait`](Trait)),
//! e.g. a human-readable name as string.  Each name is unique, and has an
//! associated value and owner.  Everyone can read the database of names, but
//! only the owner can make changes to it.  This typically means changing the
//! value to publish some data with the name, but the owner can also transfer
//! names to a different owner.
//!
//! Names are given out on a *first come, first serve* basis.  Each name that
//! is not yet registered (and valid for the system) can be registered by
//! any account (which may incur a fee for registration, and then maybe also
//! for updates to the name).  Once registered, the name is owned by the
//! account that first registered it.
//!
//! After a certain number of blocks, names may expire and become usable again.
//! By updating a name before the expiration, the current owner can keep
//! ownership.
//!
//! The `names` module defines basic extrinsics to perform name operations
//! ([register](Module::update) / [update](Module::update) /
//! [transfer](Module::transfer) names) and [events](RawEvent) corresponding to
//! changes in the name database.  But if custom logic needs to be applied in
//! addition by the runtime, it may use the exposed functions
//! [`check_assuming_signed`](Module::check_assuming_signed) and
//! [`execute`](Module::execute) directly.  The name database can be accessed
//! from external code by using [`lookup`](Module::lookup).
